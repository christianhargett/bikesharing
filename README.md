# bikesharing

## Overview

### Citibike is a bike sharing app that allows people in NYC to rent out bikes by the trip. After visiting NYC with our friend, Kate, we decide that we want to bring the bike sharing market to Des Moines. Kate knows an angel investor that is prepared to hear our pitch, but first we must put together an analysis in order to better understand the bikeshare market in NYC. In order to do this, we will look at bikeshare data for the month of August. We will use Tableau in order to better understand the trends in the bikeshare data.
